# Project Euler Responses

So I'm an avid reader of articles from [Medium](https://medium.com/), and recently
finished reading [this](https://blog.usejournal.com/consider-yourself-a-developer-you-should-solve-the-project-euler-problems-ed8d13397c9c)
post on using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) if you consider yourself a Developer. Well,
historically I am not a developer, but recognizing that developer skills are taking
over the World I've set out (after many aborted attempts) to learn to code. So this is
where my Project Euler responses will live. For anyone who stumbles across this repository,
please feel free to use my answers if you find them helpful, or provide feedback if
I could do something a bit more efficiently.
